Meeting Notes Nov. 10

2 heuristics: 
1) Simple
  Less accurate and short
  Weâ€™ll based ourselves on the heuristic used in the tic tac toe lab

2) Complex  
  More accurate but takes longer to compute
  [NEED TO FIGURE THIS ONE OUT]

TO DO list:
- Implement the skeleton
- Figure out second heuristic
- Implement the first heuristic
- Implementing a Player Class (controlled by user) and a AI Class (controlled by random)
